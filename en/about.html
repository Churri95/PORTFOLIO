            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>
                I am a third-year student in a Bachelor of Technology at the IUT of Villetaneuse,
                studying Networks and Telecommunications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although my current studies have helped me build strong skills in networking,
                cybersecurity and IT architecture, I am now considering a career change.
                My goal is to move into the social sector, more specifically to become a specialised educator,
                a field that aligns better with my values and my desire to support others.
            </p>

                    <h3>Handball 🤾‍♀️</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have been playing handball for 11 years.
                        Today, I play in the senior team at <strong>Cergy Handball</strong>,
                        and our team competes at <strong>Pre-national (Regional)</strong> level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Handball is a major part of my life: it has taught me discipline,
                        teamwork, dealing with pressure, and collective commitment.
                    </p>

                <article class="passion-card">
                    <h3>Music 🎺</h3>
                    <p>
                        I played the <strong>trombone for 2 years</strong> and the <strong>trumpet for 4 years</strong>.
                        Music used to be very important to me: I took part in school concerts
                        and in the opening of a performance venue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though I couldn’t continue, it is something I truly enjoy and it helped me develop
                        discipline, creativity, and personal expression.
